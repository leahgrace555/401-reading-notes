## Java Basics

### Variables:
- Objects store states in fields
- Kinds of variables: instance, class, local, parameters
#### Instance Variables (non-static fields):
- Declared w/o static keyword
- Values are unique to each instance of a class (object)

#### Class variables: 
- Any field declared with a static modifier
- Tells the compiler there is exactly one copy of this variable
- Ex: static int numGears = 6

#### Local Variables:
- There is no keyword to define local variables
- These are determined based on where the variable is declared
- Declared between the opening and closing brackets of a method

#### Parameters:
- Ex: Public static void main(String[] args)
- Args is a parameter of the main method
- Parameters are always classified as variables and not fields

## Reddit Thread on Compiling:

### What is compiling code?
- Computers interpret everything in 1s and 0s, which represent different electrical signals
- the code we write as humans is 'higher code', or languages created for humans to better understand
- Compiling code is how the 'human' code is translated into something the computer can understand
- Turns human readable code into an executable set of instructions for the computer
